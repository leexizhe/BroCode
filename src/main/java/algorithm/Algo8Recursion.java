public class Algo8Recursion {
    /*
    Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem, eventually reaching a base case to stop the recursion.
    It is widely used for problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems.
    Time Complexity: Depends on the problem (e.g., factorial: ùëÇ(ùëõ), Fibonacci (naive): ùëÇ(2‚Åø))

    1. Divide and Conquer: Recursion is effective for problems like merge sort, quicksort, or binary search, where the problem is divided into sub-problems.

    2. Tree and Graph Problems: It is often used for traversing trees (preorder, postorder, or inorder traversal) and graphs (DFS, backtracking).

    3. Mathematical Problems: Recursion simplifies the implementation of problems like factorials, Fibonacci sequences, and permutations/combinations.

    4. Elegance and Simplicity: Recursive solutions can be simpler and more elegant compared to iterative solutions for certain problems.

    5. Memory Usage: Recursion relies on the call stack, which can lead to higher memory usage and stack overflow if not carefully managed
    (e.g., tail recursion optimization is often needed for efficiency).

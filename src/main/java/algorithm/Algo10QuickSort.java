public class Algo10QuickSort {
    /*
    QuickSort is an efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
    It selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, placing smaller elements before it and larger elements after it.
    The process is repeated recursively on the subarrays, leading to a fully sorted array.
    Run Time Complexity: Best and Average Case: O(n log n), Worst Case: O(nÂ²) (when partitions are unbalanced)
    Space Complexity: O(log n) (due to the recursion stack)

    1. Large Data Sets: QuickSort is highly efficient for large datasets because of its O(n log n) average time complexity.

    2. In-Place Sorting: It works in-place, meaning it requires minimal additional space compared to other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort.

    3. Unstable Sorting: QuickSort is not stable, so the relative order of equal elements may not be preserved.

    4. Pivot Selection: Proper choice of the pivot is crucial for ensuring good performance. Popular strategies include picking the first, last, middle, or random element.

    5. Divide-and-Conquer Nature: QuickSort exemplifies this strategy, making it a commonly studied algorithm in computer science for understanding partitioning and recursion.

    /*
    A Tree is a hierarchical data structure that organizes elements in a parent-child relationship.

    1. Key Features:
    	- Hierarchical Structure: Data is organized in levels starting from the root.
    	- Unique Path: There's exactly one path between any two nodes, ensuring no cycles.
    	- Recursive Nature: Each subtree of a tree is itself a tree.

    2. Common Operations:
    	- Traversal: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, and Level-order traversal of nodes.
    	- Insertion: Adding new nodes while maintaining the structure.
    	- Deletion: Removing nodes and restructuring accordingly.
    	- Search: Finding a node with a specific value.

    3. Applications:
    	- Binary Search Tree (BST): Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.
    	- Expression Trees: Used in parsers and compilers for evaluating expressions.
    	- Directory Structure: Organizing folders and files in a file system.
    	- Priority Queues: Implemented using heaps, a specialized tree.
    	- Decision Trees: Commonly used in machine learning for classification problems.

    4. Advantages:
    	- Hierarchical Storage: Efficiently organizes hierarchical data.
    	- Flexible Structure: Supports various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
    	- Recursiveness: Naturally supports recursive algorithms for processing.

    5. Limitations:
    	- Space Usage: Can require significant memory for pointers in linked representation.
    	- Complex Balancing: Maintaining balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees) can be complex.
    	- Traversal Overhead: Traversing all nodes can be slow for large trees.
